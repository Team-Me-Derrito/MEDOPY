# MEDOPY
Back-end and interactive display

# Technologies
Django <br>
Database: ??? (Could be sqlite or postgres or maybe noSQL if we're feeling brave)<br>
Django does have sqlite built in otherwise can use any other...

# Dependencies and starting steps
Clone the MEDOPY repository and ensure that a recent version of Python is installed ( > 3.7) it can be installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/. This can be run using a Python environment or without. Run the following commands:
pip install Django
pip install django-cors-headers

After installing those packages navigate to MEDOPY/django_project/ subfolder and run the following command:
python(your version) manage.py runserver (Optional IP:port)
The back-end server should be running now.
