# MEDOPY
Back-end and interactive display

# Dependencies and starting steps
Clone the MEDOPY repository and ensure that a recent version of Python is installed ( > 3.7) it can be installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/. This can be run using a Python environment or without. Run the following commands:<br>
```pip install Django```<br>
```pip install django-cors-headers```

After installing those packages navigate to MEDOPY/django_project/ subfolder and run the following command:<br>
```python(your version) manage.py runserver (Optional IP:port)```<br>
The back-end server should be running now. You can confirm it is running by going to the url that is provided when you run that command. There is a meaningless html file that will show but if there are no errors then the backend is running properly.
